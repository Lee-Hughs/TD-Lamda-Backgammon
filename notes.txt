todo:
	create the model for the NN with randomized weights,
	create a method to assign each of the weight values based on a json file


network model:
	activation function for every neuron = 1/1+e-sum
	for point in board:
		1. one a
		2. two a
		3. three a
		4. if a > 3, (total a's - 3)/2
		5 - 8 same but for b
		these make the first 192 input neurons
	193: if a is moving
	194: if b is moving
	195: a's on the bar/2
	196: b's on the bar/2
	197: a's bourne off
	198: b's bourne off


loading weights:
	input layer:
		198 nodes * 50 connections: 9900 weights
	hidden layer:
		50 nodes * 1 weight
	biases:
		50 nodes * 1 + 1
